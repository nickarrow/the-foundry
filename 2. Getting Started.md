# 2. Getting Started

This is a shared vault, so if your sync is working, it will pull in everyone's characters, locations, journals, and other notes as people write and play. 

To start playing yourself, you'll need to create a campaign, or better yet, create a character inside someone else's campaign! 

Once you've created your character, its probably best to create a folder and then move that character into its folder. From there, go ahead and start playing! 

If you are looking for additional help getting started, check out [Ironvault.Quest](https://ironvault.quest/player's-guide/getting-started/04-create-your-character.html), which walks you through a full setup process. 

From here, check out [[3. Tips and Best Practices]] or check out what others are doing in the various campaigns. Consider checking out the [[Players Folder Instructions]] for more info about who is here in the vault.
