# 2. Getting Started

Welcome to The Foundry! This guide will help you set up your vault and start playing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Obsidian** - [Download here](https://obsidian.md/)
- **GitHub account** - [Sign up here](https://github.com/) (free)
- **Repository access** - Join the [Ironsworn Discord](https://discord.gg/8bRuZwK) and contact **nickarrow** to be added as a collaborator with Write permissions

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create an Empty Obsidian Vault

1. Open Obsidian
2. Click "Create new vault"
3. Name it (e.g., "The Foundry" or any name you prefer)
4. Pick a location to save it locally

**Important:** Keep this vault completely empty for now. Don't add any files or install other plugins yet.

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

Before installing FIT, you'll need to create a personal access token:

1. Go to [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name like "The Foundry - FIT Plugin"
4. Set expiration (recommend 90 days or 1 year)
5. Select these scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Copy the token immediately** - you won't be able to see it again!

### Step 3: Install and Configure FIT Plugin

FIT works best when syncing into a blank vault for the first time.

1. In Obsidian, go to Settings → Community Plugins
2. Browse and install **FIT (Minimalist File giT)** ([More info](https://github.com/joshuakto/fit))
3. Enable the FIT plugin
4. Open FIT plugin settings
5. Paste your personal access token in the token field
6. Click "Authenticate" - your GitHub username and repositories will auto-populate
7. Select **"the-foundry"** from the repository dropdown
8. Select **"main"** from the branch dropdown
9. Enable automatic syncing

**Important:** Your GitHub username must match exactly for proper ownership tracking. For security, limit the token scope to only necessary repositories.

### Step 4: Initial Sync

Once FIT is configured, trigger the initial sync. FIT will automatically pull everyone's campaigns, characters, journals, and other content into your vault. This is normal - you're now part of a shared storytelling universe!

Wait for the sync to complete before proceeding to the next step.

### Step 5: Install Iron Vault Plugin

Now that your vault has synced with The Foundry content:

1. Go to Settings → Community Plugins
2. Browse and install **Iron Vault**
3. Enable the Iron Vault plugin
4. Configure Iron Vault settings as needed for your preferred game system (Ironsworn, Starforged, or Sundered Isles)

## Creating Your First Content

You have two options for getting started:

### Option A: Start Your Own Campaign

Use Iron Vault to `Create a new campaign` and start playing. You'll generally end up with a folder structure like:

```
My-Campaign/
├── Characters/
│   └── My-Hero.md
├── Journals/
│   └── Session-1.md
└── Campaign-Index.md
```

Use Iron Vault to create your character and start playing. FIT will automatically sync your files to GitHub, and The Foundry will mark you as the owner.

### Option B: Join an Existing Campaign (Recommended!)

The real magic of The Foundry is collaborative storytelling:

1. Browse the existing campaigns in the vault (e.g., `The Starforged/`)
2. Create your character file in their campaign folder: `The Starforged/Characters/YourCharacter.md`
3. Write your journal entries: `The Starforged/Journals/YourJournal.md`
4. Start playing!

Both you and the campaign creator can see each other's content, but neither can edit the other's files. The world grows organically!

## Understanding File Ownership

When you create a file, you own it. The Foundry automatically adds ownership metadata for your files in our registry. This means:

- You can freely edit, rename, move, or delete your own files
- You can read everyone else's files
- You cannot edit or delete files owned by others
- If you accidentally try to edit someone else's file, The Foundry will automatically restore it
