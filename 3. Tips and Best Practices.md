# 3. Tips and Best Practices

## Organizing Your Content

**Use folders to keep things organized.** Since this vault contains multiple players' campaigns, a clear folder structure helps everyone navigate. Iron Vault helps by providing a folder scaffold, but you can create files and folders anywhere in the repository - there are no path restrictions. Feel free to organize your content however makes sense for your story.

## Collaborative Campaigns

**Join existing campaigns!** The Foundry shines when players contribute to each other's worlds:

- Create your character in someone else's campaign folder
- Write journal entries from your character's perspective
- Add locations, NPCs, or other content that enriches the shared world
- Remember: you can only edit files you create, but you can read everything

**Example:** If you want to join "The Starforged" campaign, create `The Starforged/Characters/YourCharacter.md` and start playing. The campaign creator can read your content but can't edit it, and vice versa.

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive folder and file names
- Avoid special characters that might cause issues across platforms
- Hyphens or underscaces work great (e.g., `My-Character.md` or `My_Character.md`)
- Spaces are fine too, but some players prefer hyphens for consistency

## Recommended Plugins

Beyond the required plugins (Iron Vault and FIT), consider installing these optional plugins to enhance your experience:

**Required:**
- `Iron Vault` - For playing Ironsworn, Starforged, or Sundered Isles (you need this!)
- `FIT` - For syncing with GitHub (you need this too!)

**Optional but useful:**
- `Dataview` - Create fancy character sheets and dynamic queries
- `Excalidraw` - Draw maps, diagrams, and visual content

## Syncing Best Practices

**Let FIT handle syncing automatically.** The plugin will sync your changes in the background. If you see a sync conflict:

- Wait a moment and try again
- The enforcement pipeline prevents most conflicts automatically
- Your valid edits are always preserved

**If your edits disappear:** This means you tried to edit a file you don't own. The Foundry automatically restored it. Create your own file instead!

## Common Questions

**Can I rename or move my files?**
Yes! You own your files, so you can rename, move, or delete them freely.

**Can I delete someone else's file?**
No. The Foundry will automatically restore it.

**What if I accidentally edit someone else's file?**
No worries! The Foundry will silently restore it on the next sync. No harm done.

**Can multiple people edit the same file?**
No. Each file has exactly one owner. For collaborative content, create separate files that reference each other.

**How do I know who owns a file?**
Check the frontmatter at the top of the file - it shows the `file_owner` field.
