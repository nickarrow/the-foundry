# The Foundry

> A shared narrative universe for **Ironsworn**, **Starforged**, and **Sundered Isles** players

## Welcome to The Foundry
This website is a capture of the currently active collaborative storytelling repository where players using **Obsidian + Iron Vault** can

- 📖 **Publish your campaigns** — Share your adventures with the community
- 🔍 **Explore others' stories** — Read the campaigns, characters, and journals around you
- 🤝 **Collaborate organically** — Add your character to someone else's campaign, write journal entries that interweave with theirs
- 🌍 **Build shared worlds** — Watch the universe grow as players contribute to each other's stories

Feel free to browse journals, characters, or other campaign files.

**Or if you want to join in**, see [[2. Getting Started]]
