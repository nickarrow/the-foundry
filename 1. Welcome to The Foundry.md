# 1. Welcome to The Foundry
**The Foundry** is a collaborative storytelling repository where players using **Obsidian + Iron Vault** can:
- 📖 **Publish their entire campaign vault** - share your adventures with the community
- 🔍 **Explore other campaigns** - read and discover the stories of fellow players
- 🌍 **Build shared worlds** - contribute to campaigns and create interconnected narratives
- 🤝 **Collaborate organically** - add characters, journals, and content to any campaign

The Foundry uses automatic governance through GitHub Actions to manage permissions and ownership, making collaboration effortless and invisible.

## This shared vault has adopted the Ironsworn Discord's rules

We have only a few simple rules designed to help keep this community positive and inclusive. 

**1. Hateful ideologies are not tolerated** This includes but is not limited to hate speech based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other attacks on one’s personhood. 

**2. Be kind** Discuss, don't argue. Respect the input of others. Everyone’s contributions, experiences, and approaches are valued (though see rule #1). Threatening behavior, abuse, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated. 

**3. Keep it clean** Avoid NSFW content. If in doubt, mark it as NSFW or provide a content warning and enclose it in spoiler tags 

**4. Support creators** Do not upload commercial PDFs or links to pirated materials, and do not discuss pirated content.
