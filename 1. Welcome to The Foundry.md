# 1. Welcome to The Foundry

> A shared narrative universe for **Ironsworn**, **Starforged**, and **Sundered Isles** players

**The Foundry** is a collaborative storytelling repository where players using **Obsidian + Iron Vault** can:
- 📖 **Publish their entire campaign vault** - share your adventures with the community
- 🔍 **Explore other campaigns** - read and discover the stories of fellow players
- 🌍 **Build shared worlds** - contribute to campaigns and create interconnected narratives
- 🤝 **Collaborate organically** - add characters, journals, and content to any campaign

The Foundry uses automatic governance through GitHub Actions to manage permissions and ownership, making collaboration effortless and invisible.

## How The Foundry Works

Every file in The Foundry has exactly one owner. When you create a file, you own it. When someone else creates a file, they own it. Simple.

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Create new files anywhere in the repository
- ✅ Edit, rename, move, or delete your own files
- ✅ Read everyone's files
- ❌ Edit or delete files owned by others

**What happens if you try to edit someone else's file?**

The Foundry automatically detects unauthorized edits and silently restores the file to its correct state. Your next sync will pull the corrected version. No errors, no drama, just clean content.

## Community Guidelines

The Foundry has adopted the community rules from the [Ironsworn Discord](https://discord.gg/8bRuZwK). We have only a few simple rules designed to help keep this community positive and inclusive:

**1. Hateful ideologies are not tolerated.** This includes but is not limited to hate speech based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other attacks on one's personhood.

**2. Be kind.** Discuss, don't argue. Respect the input of others. Everyone's contributions, experiences, and approaches are valued (though see rule #1). Threatening behavior, abuse, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated.

**3. Keep it clean.** Avoid NSFW content. If in doubt, mark it as NSFW or provide a content warning and enclose it in spoiler tags.

**4. Support creators.** Do not upload commercial PDFs or links to pirated materials, and do not discuss pirated content.

**5. Be respectful.** This is a shared creative space - don't create excessive empty files or folders.
