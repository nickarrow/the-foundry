# Welcome to The Foundry

This is welcome page includes — guidelines, philosophy, and what makes The Foundry tick.

## Community Guidelines

The Foundry follows the community rules from the [Ironsworn Discord](https://discord.gg/8bRuZwK):

**1. Hateful ideologies are not tolerated.** This includes but is not limited to hate speech based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or any other attacks on one's personhood.

**2. Be kind.** Discuss, don't argue. Respect the input of others. Everyone's contributions, experiences, and approaches are valued (though see rule #1). Threatening behavior, abuse, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated.

**3. Keep it clean.** Avoid NSFW content. When in doubt, mark it as NSFW or use content warnings.

**4. Support creators.** Do not upload commercial PDFs or links to pirated materials, and do not discuss pirated content.

**5. Be respectful.** This is a shared creative space.

**6. The "Yes, and..." Philosophy** The Foundry embraces the improv principle of building on others' contributions rather than negating them.

While The Foundry's technical systems prevent you from editing or deleting other players' files, you can still write whatever you want in your *own* files. This is where "Yes, and..." becomes a social contract:

**What this means in practice:**
- **Don't narratively destroy what others create.** Even in your own journals, avoid writing that another player's character died, their settlement was obliterated, or their faction was wiped out. Their creations are theirs to conclude.
- **Build on, don't bulldoze.** Reference others' content as inspiration, not as targets. Add to the universe rather than subtracting from it.
- **Treat others' creations as living stories.** That character, location, or faction might still be in active play. Write as if the original creator might continue their story tomorrow.
- **When in doubt, go adjacent.** Instead of writing definitive outcomes for others' content, write about rumors, near-misses, or your character's *perception* of events.

## Collaborative World-Building

The real magic of The Foundry happens when players contribute to each other's worlds:

1. **Browse existing campaigns** — Find a world that interests you
2. **Create your character there** — Add your hero to their folder
3. **Write your own journals** — Your perspective on their world
4. **Watch it grow** — Both of you see the shared universe expand

You own your files. They own theirs. Neither can edit the other's work. The world grows organically through addition, not modification.
