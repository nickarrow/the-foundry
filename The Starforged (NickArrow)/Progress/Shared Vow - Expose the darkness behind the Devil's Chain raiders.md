# Expose the darkness behind the Devil's Chain raiders and stop it from spreading

**Rank:** Extreme (20 progress marks to fill)

**The Trouble:**
An unnamed and powerful pirate clan has emerged in Devil's Chain, striking with unnatural precision and wielding powers that defy explanation. Settlements like Reck lie in ruins, plagued by terrifying manifestations in the pirates' wake. Rumors speak of Remnant technology, horrors, or something worse. Whatever the source of their power, it's spreading — and it may already be beyond their control.
