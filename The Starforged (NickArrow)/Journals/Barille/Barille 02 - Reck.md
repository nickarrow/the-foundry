# [[Barille 02 - Reck]]

`iv-noroll:Begin a Session|move:starforged/session/begin_a_session`  `iv-meter:Momentum|5|6` 

EXT. SNUB FIGHTER 27 REENTRY TO ACKRISS-2

The 27 bursts through the purple and green clouds of [[Ackriss-2]]. Scans are showing a toxic atmosphere and remnants of ash. Likely from regular volcanic eruptions. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
This is SN27 on approach, anyone down there?

NO RESPONSE
```

> [[Reck]] itself is built into the rock cliffs of a large canyon. The rock providing a natural shield from the harsh atmosphere. A settlement supporting thousands, out in the frontier of the Expanse. 

Barille circles the settlement, and sees an impact crater and wreckage. It looks like the attacking frigate crashed into the settlement on the south side. Not good. Smoke is coming out of the wreckage. 

Barille eyes what looks like a landing port nearby. The auto-landing sequence takes over, and Barille tries to ping the transport ship. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
Hey, did you make it down here? Any injured. This is Barille. 

COMMS OFFICER
Reading you Barille, yeah, we’re all in one piece. That was you in the fighter right? 

BARILLE BLACK
Yeah, any idea who that was?

COMMS OFFICER
They transmitted a pretty long message, something about the Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds? That mean anything to you?

BARILLE BLACK
Nope. Never heard of them. Trouble is, the suicided into Reck, so I guess we can’t ask them. I can't raise anyone down there, trouble?

COMMS OFFICER
Yeah, the impact shook the entire canyon and its been pretty much disaster mode down here. Reck is pretty wild on a good day, but the suicide attack has everyone either panicked or fighting fires. 

BARILLE BLACK
Got it. Thanks for the info. Barille out. 
```

> So we have a name. `iv-entity-create:Faction|Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds|The Starforged (NickArrow)/Factions/Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds.md` A bit of a mouthful, and clearly not the most inconspicuous bunch. 

Barille check's to see if the landing has an automated repair system. Negative. Okay, can I send a message? 

```
BARILLE BLACK - Typing via hand terminal
*Landing bay 17, SN27 - Barille Black, requesting repairs.* 

Yeah, I'm going to need to talk to someone. 
```

 > Okay, so that’s fine. Need to start investigating for the [[Risen Union]] anyway. Let's go for a walk. 

Before leaving Barille sends out an encoded wideband broadcast.  `iv-noroll:Reach a Milestone|move:starforged/quest/reach_a_milestone` 

![[Message 01 - Barille Black]]

`iv-track-advance:Expose the darkness behind the attacks across Devil's Chain and stop it from spreading|The Starforged (NickArrow)/Progress/Expose the darkness behind the attacks across the sector and stop it from spreading.md|0|2|extreme|1` 

Barille get's out of his fighter and sets off. He reflects on the little bit of information he has about the so called "horrors" of Reck. The job just stated "terrifying manifestations" not a lot to go on. Need to ask around. And someone has gone missing, let's find anyone in charge.  `iv-move:Gather Information|Wits|1|2|0|9|4|move:starforged/adventure/gather_information` 

> What is the dire threat or unwelcome truth?  `iv-oracle:Action + Theme|68|Journey Opportunity|oracle_rollable:starforgedsupp/templates/actiontheme` Reck is a frontier settlement with an *obvious social stratification*. It looks like there may be a bit of a revolution happening, and Barille just found himself smack in the middle of it. Good luck getting your ship repaired any time soon, and also...  `iv-oracle:Pay the Price|98|Your vehicle suffers damage, Your action causes collateral damage or has an unintended effect|move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/pay_the_price.pay_the_price`

> Looks like my message has attracted the wrong kind of attention. 

A sudden crash and screeching of metal is heard from behind Barille, in the landing bay. He runs back to see the large grapple hook digging into the side of the 27. `iv-meter:Snub Fighter / Integrity|2|1` 

There's also a small group of folk that have gathered, scavengers or otherwise and two big guys step in front of Barille. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
Hey friends, seems like you have gone and put a hook into my ship. 

SCAVENGER 1
I think you mean our ship. You picked the wrong day to show up, we control the entire east ward now. 

BARILLE BLACK
Yeah, that's fine. *Barille pulls out a cigarette and lites it* You can have the east ward, but I'm going to need my ship. How about, you ungrapple it and we don't have to turn this into a... thing.
```

`iv-move:Compel|Heart|5|3|0|4|5|move:starforged/adventure/compel`  `iv-meter:Momentum|6|7` 

```
SCAVENGER 1
Huh. I figured you we're just going to try and pull a gun and... look if you stay out of our way, you can keep this ship. Looks pretty beat up anyway. Just remember, the east ward is ours.

BARILLE BLACK
Got it. And who is "Us" exactly? 

SCAVENGER 1
We're with "Murad", and she owns it. Got that!

BARILLE BLACK
Understood. *Takes a long drag on the *cigarette*, congrats to her. 
```
