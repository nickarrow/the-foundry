# [[Barille 02 - Reck]]

EXT. SNUB FIGHTER ‘27’ REENTRY TO ACKRISS-2

The 27 bursts through the purple and green clouds of [[Ackriss-2]]. Scans are showing a toxic atmosphere and remnants of ash. Likely from regular volcanic eruptions. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
This is SN27 on approach, anyone down there?

NO RESPONSE
```

> [[Reck]] itself is built into the rock cliffs of a large canyon. The rock providing a natural shield from the harsh atmosphere. A settlement supporting thousands, out in the frontier of the Expanse. 

Barille circles the settlement, and sees an impact crater and wreckage. It looks like the attacking frigate crashed into the settlement on the south side. Not good. Smoke is coming out of the wreckage. 

Barille eyes what looks like a landing port nearby. The auto-landing sequence takes over, and Barille tries to ping the transport ship. 

```
BARILLE BLACK
Hey, did you make it down here? Any injured. This is Barille. 

COMMS OFFICER
Reading you Barille, yeah, we’re all in one piece. That was you in the fighter right? 

BARILLE BLACK
Any idea who that was?

COMMS OFFICER
They transmitted a pretty long message, something about the Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds? That mean anything to you?

BARILLE BLACK
Nope. Never heard of them. Trouble is, the suicided into Reck, so I guess we can’t ask them. You need anything?

COMMS OFFICER
Yeah, the impact shook the entire canyon and its been pretty much disaster mode down here. We’re fine, thanks anyway.

> So we have a name. `iv-entity-create:Faction|Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds|The Starforged (NickArrow)/Factions/Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds.md` A bit of a mouthful, and clearly not the most inconspicuous bunch. 

Barille accesses the landing bay’s UI and requisitions a repair crew.  `iv-move:Repair|Supply|3|5|0|6|9|move:starforged/recover/repair` Looks like a full repair is possible, how long will this take?  `iv-oracle:Number|71|Many|oracle_rollable:sundered_isles/misc/magnitude/number` Not a quick fix though, many hours or a few days. Probably a few days. That’s fine. Need to start investigating for the [[Risen Union]] anyway. 

Before leaving  `iv-noroll:Reach a Milestone|move:starforged/quest/reach_a_milestone` Barille sends out an encoded wideband broadcast.
