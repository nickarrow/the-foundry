The Starforged campaign is setup to be played in the standard Starforged setting, except it includes the recommended Sundered Isle's assets and a few Sundered Isles oracles that I think work really well in Starforged (Magnitude, size, weather, etc.). 

Feel free to join in! I am about to start [[Barille Black]]'s
