# [[The Starforged (NickArrow)]]
This campaign campaign is setup to be played in the standard Starforged setting, except it includes the recommended Sundered Isle's assets and a few Sundered Isles oracles that I think work really well in Starforged (Magnitude, size, weather, etc.). 

Feel free to join in, or read the latest adventures of [[Barille 01 - Beginnings|Barille Black]]!
