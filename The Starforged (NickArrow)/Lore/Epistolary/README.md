# Epistolary Letters — The Starforged

> Drop your Spotlight Letters here to contribute to the shared story.

## The Trouble

A notorious pirate clan has emerged in Devil's Chain, striking with unnatural precision and wielding powers that defy explanation. Settlements like Reck lie in ruins, plagued by terrifying manifestations in the pirates' wake. Rumors speak of Remnant technology, ghost light rituals, or something worse. Whatever the source of their power, it's spreading — and it may already be beyond their control.

## The Shared Vow

**"Expose the darkness behind the Devil's Chain raiders and stop it from spreading"** (Extreme)

See: [[Shared Vow - Expose the darkness behind the Devil's Chain raiders]]

## How to Contribute

1. Play your game — run your character through adventures in Devil's Chain
2. When you have something meaningful to share — a milestone or a narrative moment worth telling — write a Spotlight Letter
3. Drop it in this folder
4. If your letter represents a milestone, the Organizer marks progress on the Shared Vow

**The Spotlight Rule:** You can't write two Spotlight Letters in a row. Wait for another player to post before writing again.

## Letter Format

Your Spotlight Letter can be anything in-character:
- An actual letter to someone
- A journal entry or captain's log
- A report to a contact
- A recording transmitted across the void

Focus on the narrative, not the dice. See [[Letter Template]] for a starting point.
