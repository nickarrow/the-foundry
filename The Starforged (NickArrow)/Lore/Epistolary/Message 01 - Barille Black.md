# Encoded Wideband Broadcast

Sending this out on wideband, encoded. Encountered a new faction [[Ascendancy of the Awakened Worlds]]. Unprovoked attack on transport ship, likely pirate activity. They first appeared to be conventional raiders, during the engagement they produced technology that I was unable to identify or scan.

To further confound matters, the pirate frigate made a suicide run on the settlement of [[Reck]] in the [[Ackriss-2]] system. 

To anyone listening, be on the lookout. It is possible this pirate faction may attempt additional unconventional attacks.
